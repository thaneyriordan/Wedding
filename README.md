Kay + Dave's Wedding Website
=============================
This is the wedding website of [Kaitlin Thaney](http://kaythaney.com/) and [David Riordan](http://twitter.com/riordan). Yes, we're total nerds obsessed with open source and open licensing.

# Getting started with editing

 * `git clone git@github.com:thaneyriordan/wedding.git`
* Install the requisite code
 * `bundle install`

# Content Updates
* Homepage text updates at `index.html`
* Image assets live in `/images`
 * Check the CSS + the page layouts for where they are
* Icons from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) can be changed with their `fa-` codes
 * located in both the HTML + the CSS files
